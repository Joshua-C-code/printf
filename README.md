Project by Joshua and Abimbola
This project involves implementing various features in the C printf function, covering a range of conversion specifiers and customization options. Here's a breakdown of the tasks:

Implement basic functionality and handle common conversion specifiers.
Introduce custom conversion specifiers to extend the capabilities of the printf function.
Enhance the handling of specific conversion specifiers.
Optimize the function by using a local buffer and minimizing calls to the write function.
Address a custom conversion specifier for handling specific print formats.
Handle the pointer conversion specifier (%p) in the printf function.
Implement flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Address length modifiers (l and h) for non-custom conversion specifiers, including d, i, u, o, x, and X.
Manage field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Handle precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Implement the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Manage the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Introduce a custom conversion specifier for a specific functionality.
Implement another custom conversion specifier for a distinct feature.
Ensure that all options are compatible and function well together.
